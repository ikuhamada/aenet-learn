# Learning how to use aenet

This is a repository contaning files and directories used to learn how to use [aenet](http://ann.atomistic.net/).

## Preliminaries

First of all, generate.x, train.x, and predict.x are compiled successfully and path to these programs is properly set.
These executable has different names, depending on the environment and platform they are compiled.

In the subdirectories, you can find the following directories:

```Bash
01-generate/  02-train/  03-test/  04-predict/	xsf/
```

``01-generate/``, ``02-train/``, ``03-test/``, and ``04-predict`` are used to generate a training set, to train the neural network, to verify the neural network potential, and to predict the energies of given strucures.
``xsf/`` contains the reference structures and energies to learn.

## Directions

### Lenard-Jones potential

### Water dimer

### Argon dimer
